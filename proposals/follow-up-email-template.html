        <p>Hi [Client Name],</p>
        
        <p>I hope you've had a chance to explore the SocialCloud demo platform I created. I'm genuinely excited about the possibility of helping you establish SocialCloud as <span class="highlight">the technology leader</span> in talent management.</p>
        
        <p>A few things I wanted to highlight that we didn't get to discuss in detail:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The AI-powered analytics</strong> could help you identify trending opportunities 72 hours before your competitors</li>
            <li><strong>The automated media kit generator</strong> would save your team approximately 15 hours per week</li>
            <li><strong>The multi-language support</strong> opens up international brand partnerships immediately</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I've attached a detailed proposal outlining how we can bring this vision to life. The investment options are designed to be flexible‚Äîwe can start with the core platform and phase in advanced features based on your priorities.</p>
        
        <p>I'm confident this platform will not only streamline your operations but also become a <span class="highlight">key differentiator</span> when pitching to both creators and brands.</p>
        
        <p>Would you be available for a brief call this week to discuss the proposal? I'm free [Day] afternoon or [Day] morning, but happy to work around your schedule.</p>
        
        <p>Looking forward to building something exceptional together.</p>
        
        <div class="signature">

        <h3>Second Follow-up (If needed after 1 week):</h3>
        
        <p>Hi [Client Name],</p>
        
        <p>I wanted to check in briefly‚ÄîI know how busy things can get managing multiple high-profile creators.</p>
        
        <p>The demo platform is still live if you'd like to share it with your team: [demo link]</p>
        
        <p>If you have any questions about the proposal or would like to explore different options, I'm here to help. Even if the timing isn't right now, I'd value your feedback on the concept.</p>
